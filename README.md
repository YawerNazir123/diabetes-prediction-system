🩺 Diabetes Prediction System

An AI-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using patient health parameters. The system integrates a trained machine learning model with a modern Flask-based web interface.

🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

Data-driven model training

Model serialization

Backend integration

Frontend user interaction

Live deployment

The application is designed to assist in early risk detection by analyzing commonly used medical indicators.

⚙️ Features

Predicts diabetes risk (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

Clean, responsive, modern UI

Real-time predictions

Multiple pages (Home, About, Model Details)

Deployed live on the internet

🧠 Machine Learning Model

The system uses a supervised classification model trained on medical diagnostic data.

Input Features:

Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Output:

Binary classification: Diabetic / Non-Diabetic

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Backend: Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Deployment: Render

Version Control: GitHub
